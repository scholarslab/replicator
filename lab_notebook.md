Taking another stab at the headjoint of the alto flute:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31610

Several attempts building it on its side on a raft due to the little
ridges, raft builds fine but gets mucked up shortly after

On its end the headjoint is too tall, so trying it at .8 scale. The
"Exterior Support" option looks like it produces a lot of extra
unnecessary plastic, so stopping this build...

Trying for a fourth (or fifth?) time now...  .8 scale verticle, raft but
no "Exterior Support". Build seems to be progressing well, about a third
complete.

Came in this morning to find an almost complete headjoint! Looks like
the thing fell over at the very end, so the end cap didn't fully
complete. But it's functional. It plays! Next time I'll remember to
print tall objects in their most stable position (big end DOWN).

Next I'm going to get a little ambitious and try printing all three
pieces of the flute in once shot. I've used blender to combine the three
pieces, scaled by .8, into one file so they'll print in what looks like
a sensible upright position on a raft.

Still going without the 'exterior support' option for now, though this
may be helpful. Hoping that the three pieces together on a raft will be
more stable and less likely to fall over. Given how well the headjoint
did in a very unstable upright position (I can't balance the thing on
the table on its small end) I bet this will be fine...
