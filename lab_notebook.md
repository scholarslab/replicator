Taking another stab at the headjoint of the alto flute:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31610

Several attempts building it on its side on a raft due to the little
ridges, raft builds fine but gets mucked up shortly after

On its end the headjoint is too tall, so trying it at .8 scale. The
"Exterior Support" option looks like it produces a lot of extra
unnecessary plastic, so stopping this build...

Trying for a fourth (or fifth?) time now...  .8 scale verticle, raft but
no "Exterior Support". Build seems to be progressing well, about a third
complete.
